                <p>For Homeroom, I collaborated with 3 other artists to create a short game. Homeroom is a collaborative 
                    game for 4 players in which one player is targeted by police. The other 3 players need to utilize 
                    the classroom and each other to help block the police from reaching their target and help their 
                    classmate escape! Everything in Homeroom from the music to the animations to the server code was
                    made from scratch.  </p>

                <p>
                    We wanted Homeroom to have a unique and fun style. Inspired by games such as Fall Guys and Starve 
                    Together we went for a flat, colorful and cartoonish style, making the heads and eyes on our characters
                    very large and the models fairly low-poly.

                <h1>Game Mechanics</h1>
                <p>
                    Homeroom is fundamentally a team based game based on cooperation and we wanted our mechanics to reflect 
                    that. The mechanics we created are meant to inspire quick thinking and team tactics, with the game being 
                    hard to play without proper communication. 
                </p>
                <h2>Movement</h2> 
                <p>
                    We designed our levels to be based on a grid, this allows our players to clearly see the more rigid, 
                    robotic movement of the police agents and predict where they would go. The targeted player is slower 
                    than the agents, making them an easy catch if they go without help from their classmates. 
                </p>
                <h2>Body Blocking</h2> 
                <p>The main way for players to slow the police agents is to slow them with their own body. This allows
                     players to form barricades, kiting and slowing agents away from the door for an escape. </p>
                <img src="./images/homeroom/mechanics01.gif" class="p80">
                <img src="./images/homeroom/desk.png" class="floated">
                <h2>Desks</h2>
                <p>Desks function as a way to inhibit the movement of the police agents and the players. We gave the 
                    non-targeted players the ability to slowly push desks and manipulate the level. With proper timing 
                    this allows players to set traps and reroute police agents, turning each level into a kind of puzzle 
                    and allowing emergent opportunities to arise for creative players. </p>
                <h2>Backpacks</h2>
                <p>Backpacks can be picked up and spilled onto the ground to further slow a police agent down. We added this
                     mechanic as a way to balance the game, making levels harding in layout but adding backpacks to even it out. 
                </p>

                <h2>Testing</h2>
                <p>
                    We used a quick mockup of our game made in p5js and networked with node.js and socket.io to quickly test out
                     mechanics and enemy AI. This allowed us to see how “fun” our game was with a variety of players and make quick
                      adjustments before really refining its visual style. 
                </p>

            <section id="levels">
                <h1>Level Design</h1>
                <p>
                    Due to the limited, grid-like nature of our levels, proper level design was key to making the game balanced
                     and fun. We started with various simple mockups made in photoshop and played through them on paper with one
                      tester acting as the AI and 4 testers acting as people. 
                </p>
                <div class="content-wrap">
                    <div class="column">

                </div>
                <p>Our goal with each level was to slowly introduce each mechanic into the game and require more precise teamwork. 
                    For example, the first level arranges the desks in such a way that none of them can be pushed, thus forcing 
                    players to learn how to use their bodies only to block the police agent. </p>
