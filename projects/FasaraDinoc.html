          <h2>As a Salesperson at 3M...</h2>
          <p>... A sale is less about finding one product to suit the client's needs and more about narrowing down the already extensive list of 3M products into a curated selection. Within the realm of architectural finishes specifically it is up to the salesperson to walk the client through the in's and out's of 3M's film catalogue, helping the client grasp which materials and patterns would best suit a space.</p>
        </div>
        <p>The challenge quickly becomes how best to showcase so many material samples quickly and effectively. Mockup images can only go so far, samples dont capture a sense of scale, and setting up display of the product takes time and effort. </p>

        <h2>Recreating 3M Archtictural Finishes</h2>
        <p>This project centers mainly around 3M's architectural and glass finishes FASARA™ and DI-NOC™. FASARA™ Glass Finishes are semi-translucent, textured films that, when applied to glass, can be used to control the amout of light and privacy in a space while enhancing the interior's aesthetics. Later on the app's usage branched out to include the DI-NOC™ product line as well. DI-NOC™ is a thick, printed film that mimics the roughness, specularity, and color of other materials for a fraction of the cost.</p>

      <p>Before beginning the design process for this tool it was first crucial to create digital samples of the product line to determine if it was feasable to render high quality material previews live in AR on a mobile device. After all, what's the point of a product showcase that can't properly showcase the products?<br><br>After constant comparison to the real product and much tweaking, I created sample gradiated blur shaders as well as pattern approxamations using URP's shader graph in unity and some custom GLSL.</p>

        <h2>Lo-Fi Mockups</h2>
        <p>I worked with 3M Japan's design team to review the main points of the FASARA sales process that the app should highlight. The main focus was on FASARA's flexable pattern size, color and blur, as well as possible custom material masking to client spec.</p>

        <h2>Simplicty & Speed</h2>
        <p>After news of an immidiate potential use in 3M's showcase of the FASARA Natural Series at the Milan Design Salone 2022 the app took a quick detour from a daily-use sales tool to instead function as a quick, one time showcase. This drastically changed the context the app was being used in and the design needed to shift to reflect that. </p>
      </div>
      <p>We refined the flow, cutting out any complex features such as pattern customization and focusing instead on making an explorable experience that users could jump in and out of at any time without a defined start or end of the experience. Additionally, instead navigating via separate menus and pages, the app could now be freely explored with swipes in any direction, encouraging free discovery of new interesting designs.</p>

        <h2>Pivoting to DI-NOC™</h2>
        <p>After success in Milan, the business saught to showcase a similar app in Milan 2023 with a focus on DI-NOC™ Architectural finishes this time. Intent of improving from last year, the goal was to streamline the app and integrate it into the demo space more seamlessly.</p>
      </div>
      <p>In Milan 2023 3M collaborated with StudioPepe, an italian design firm based in Milan, for the interior design of this years booth. Showcasing the flexibility and veriety of DINOC, the booth was comprised of warm materials and curved abstract layouts.</p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>With the StudioPepe's design style in mind, we modified the display surface from a framed pane to more natural, organic shapes. Projecting product info also allowed more content to be displayed within the booth without disrupting the booth design too much.</p>

        <h2>Learning From Last Time</h2>
        <p>With a lot more prep time and a clearer vision, the goal of this years display was to improve upon the noted issues from 2022. The two standout issues were lighting discepencies between the area of the show and the content displayed as well as a general confusion on how to scan and place AR content.</p>
      </div>
      <p>By getting involved in the booth design early it was possible to match the booths exact lighting to the scene in order to better immerse AR content in the space. We also swapped to using a QR code to place content in order to cut out the need for scanning entirely.</p>
