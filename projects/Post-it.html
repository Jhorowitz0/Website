          <h2>The Next Step in Product Showcases</h2>
          <p>Wearables are poised to revolutionize the ways in which we interact with physical products. Although widespread adoption by consumers may still be on the horizon, the current capability to develop captivating interactive product showcases already exists.</p>
        </div>
        <p>This project served as an exploration into the potential of AR wearables to offer a fresh perspective on a familiar, household brand. We selected Post-it due to it's visability and unique branding.</p>
        <div class="blockText">
          <p>The project employed the use of AR wearables to guide users through the creation of large scale Post-it murals. The end result being both a personal immersive experience and a public collaborative product display.</p>

        <h2>Murals, Murals, Murals</h2>
        <p>We knew that getting a thorough grasp of the mural creation process was key. So, we dove right in and began both making and watching others make Post-it murals.</p>
      </div>
      <p>Notes and observations from these sessions were compiled and refined into a journey map that broke down the mural creation process.</p>

        <p class="caption"><em>Post-it Mural Journey</em></p>
      </div>
      <p>As we got familiar with the mural construction process, we noticed several key pain points that could be tackled effectively by AR wearables.</p>
      <div class="keyPoints">
        <div>
          <img src="./../img/post-it/scaleicon.png">
          <h3>Scale & Location</h3>
          <p>People typically had a tough time envisioning how big their mural would be initially, often severely under-estimating the amount of space needed.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <img src="./../img/post-it/gridicon.png">
          <h3>Grid Issues</h3>
          <p>People struggled with placing Post-its in a grid. To maintain a grid, people needed to build off of adjacent Post-its, resulting in the need to carry multiple stacks at a time.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>Following our research, we held a series of quick brainstorming sessions which resulted in a few different AR app concepts. Using Figma, we then created mockups that reflected these ideas and slowly worked on merging together what worked.</p>
      <p>At first, the app's layout was fairly simple, only utilizing a two-dimensional on-the-wall interface. But as we continued to iterate, more complex interfaces like hand menus and floating consoles started to be used.</p>

        <h2>Getting Comfortable With 3D</h2>
        <p>This being the first time I had designed a 3D interface, I struggled with the best way to arrange content in space and decide which features should be available in specific contexts.</p>
      </div>
      <p>Our layouts went through several rounds of redesigns before they started to become coherent. To help us stay organized, we created a simple outline that broke down the features available, the form they these features would take, and how they changed depending on which stage of process the user was on.</p>
      <div class="showcase">
        <img src="./../img/post-it/post-it_ux.PNG">
      </div>
      <p>From this initial plan we were able to make some functional prototypes in Unity to test the effectiveness of an AR guide with side-by-side mural construction.</p>

        <h2>Augmenting the Post-it Brand</h2>
        <p>A very large part of making a responsive AR interface is perfecting how it responds to the users input. How to things let you know that they exist in the space with you and not on a screen on your head? By using motion and sound to react. This is an unexplored new dimension of the Post-it brand.</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Post-it as a brand is quite established across physical packaging, web pages and digital content. While it would have been easy to utilize the pre-existing brand when designing the UI, we sought to push the brand in a more kinetic, fun direction; in stark contrast to most of the clean, futuristic ar app branding nowadays. We focused on post-it brands' hand drawn elements a lot, leaning into the work-in progress brainstorm feel

      </div>
      <p>
        When centering an AR app around Post-it we decided that the presence of that post-it notes should be pervasive throughout the experience. The sounds of swooshing paper, scribbling markers and sticking adhesive make the interfaces feel like theyre cobbled together from paper glue and ink. As menu's appear and dissapear any hand-drawn elements should be drawn in front of the users eyes, any paper elements should be slapped on the surface. When buttons are pressed, the whole interface should spring as if being held up by cardboard.

      <p>The final demo was so fun and successful that 3M saw a future in showcasing this application and filed a scientific patent on the use of AR headsets to assist in product based mural creation!</p>

        <h2>CES 2023</h2>
        <p>AFter my internship brought on as 3M's in-house AR prototyper. With me on the team 3M looked to expand our small intern demo into an actual large scale showcase.3M's booth at CES was the perfect place to put an experience like this in front of other engineers/designers in the field to generate interest and gain insight. Being able to attend, set up and run the booth myself informed future changes to the app as well. I got to see the typical scale that most showcases exist at as well as the practical problems with managing headsets in person and running hundreds of people through an experience.</p>

        <h2>Next Steps</h2>
        <p>The next steps for this project is to up the scale and wow factor to make large scale, interactive mural displays for 3M. Current plans are to explore the creation of large scale, multi person murals that would be built by guests of an event over multiples days. This results in a personal, engaging showcase of the post it brand and results in a large scale, physical testimate to cooperation.</p>

      <p>plans are to streamline the current experience, replace manual placement with QR anchors to sync content between headsets and across large distances without the need for wifi as well as the addition of AR guides for which colors to take and where to stand when constructing. </p>
