                <h1>Asteroid Escape</h1>
                <p>Asteroid Escape was created for the class called Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science and was my term project for the end of the semester. For this project I created a gesture based game that used input from a Kinect to map the users movements into the game.  </p>

                <h1>3D Renderer</h1>
                <p>One of the main challenges I faced when making this project was the fact that the Kinect API I was using, PyKinect, was incompatable with 3D renderers. As a solution, I decided to create my own. <p>
                <p>My 3D renderer drew points outwards from the center, the closer the point to the camera, the further out it was drawn. I could then feed the renderer sets of points, edges, and faces and it would draw objects from back to front.</p>

                <p>From there I modelled a cockpit and few asteroids in Autodesk Maya and fed the fbx files into my program by hand to create complete 3D scenes.</p>
