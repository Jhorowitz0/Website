                <h1>Glop</h1>
                <p>Glop is an experimental animation created using motion capture technology and a Style Transfer AI to create a unique looking animation. </p>

                <h1>Motion Capture</h1>
                <p>For this project, me and 2 others were tasked with creating a distinctively stylized animation in only 2 weeks. Due to the time crunch, we had to get creative with our schedule which lead to some unexpected solutions.
                    We decided that it would be faster to use Carnegie Mellon's motion capture lab instead of hand-animating the whole thing. 
                </p>
                <img src="/images/glop/motion.JPG">
                <p>We then took the motions captured, edited good takes together, and mapped our human motions onto our non-human characters in Motion Builder.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h1>Character and Environment Design</h1>
                <p>The overall character and environment design aimed to create a surreal, dreamy style. We combined body parts from rats, raccoons, and anteaters to create our creatures and used various skybox textures to create engaging landscape assets. </p>
                <img src="/images/glop/textured.PNG">
                <p>The overall model and texture polish was fairly low as most of the detail is lost during the style transfer process.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h1>Style Transfer AI</h1>
                <p>In order to ultimately achieve an interesting style in a fairly short amount of time, we decided on using a style transfer AI. Style transfer AIs are trained on a source image, learning the style of it. They can then apply that style to other images. </p>
                <img src="/images/glop/wrapper.PNG">
                <p>After training an AI on a few sketches and famous paintings, we created a rough app that allowed us to mix and match multiple styles onto our animation. Once we found a style that fit, we made another rough app that could be fed animation frames and spit out stylized frames. </p>
                <img src="/images/glop/stylized.PNG">
                <p>We then took the bulk frames and compiled them back into an animation in After Effects. After that the rest was just a matter of adding sound and editing.</p>
