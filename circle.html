                <h1>Support Circle</h1>
                <p>Support Circle was a project created for the class Interaction Design Overview at Carnegie Mellon. 
                    The assignment was to design a mobile application in the domain of “caring for a loved one”. The design question our team had to tackle was: 
                    “How do we design a novel caringtaking application in a market already saturated in this domain?” 
                    Our team focused on a human-centered design approach in making Support Circle, our mobile application design to connect careseekers with anxiety to their loved ones.

                <h1>Research</h1>
                <p>
                    To begin our process, we believed it was important to do research about the domain of caring for a loved one. 
                    There were three components in this domain: Information that a caregiver needed to keep track of a careseeker, pain points of either party, and issues with current care seeking/giving practices.
                    We believe the information the caregiver needed would be the foundation of the baseline features for our application, and the pain points/current issues would help us identify how we could make an application to improve this domain. 
                    Additionally, we performed a competitive analysis with other caregiving applications on the market to see what can be improved in this field.

                <h1>Brainstorming</h1>
                <p>
                    After conducting research on the domain, we learned the field of caregiving is heavily focused on providing support and care for elderly people. 
                    Because of the amount of caregiving applications involving elderly, we decided to change the domain of people our application would provide support for. 
                    Thus our team engaged in a sprint brainstorming session by asking the question “Who else can we care for?”
                    We decided to shift our audience to people who struggle with anxiety or panic attacks, mainly because we found a lack of caregiving applications on the market for this target audience.

                <h1>Personas and Journey Maps</h1>
                <p>In order to identify what functions our app would need, we created various personas that represented users in our app.
                    We then tried to come up with as many scenarios involving our app as possible and how it would best benefit its users.

                <p>
                    We then created a map of the personas experiences in our imaginary scenarios and mapped what their needs/emotions were in order to look for solutions.

                <h1>User Testing</h1>
                <p>
                    Once we identified some of the features and pages our app would consist of, we created a crude page flow on post-its.

                <p>
                    From there we showed the app to potential users and let them "click through" our screen concepts. We asked them to think out loud and critique anything they saw as ineffective or non-intuitive.
