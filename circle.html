                    <p> For Many people prone to panic attacks, reaching out for help can be extremely difficult.
                        During a panic attack, some people might not want to navigate through their mobile device to 
                        seek help. Additionally, spending time looking for someone who is available to help instantly 
                        might not be possible during moments of panic
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My teamates and I set out to design a mobile app that would address this problem and focus on
                        getting people emotional support at a moments notice from people they trust. We analyzed what people
                        struggle with typicall during panic attacks and what usualy inhibits them from getting help.

                <p>
                    Dealing with panic attacks is a delicate subject. Before we began designing anything we needed to 
                    understand the situations our app would be used in and what can help. Our team began by first 
                    performing basic research on the process of panic attacks and what would benefit someone having a 
                    panic attack and how to assist caregivers in aiding their loved ones.

                <h2> Interviewing Potential Users</h2>
                <p>
                    In order to get a better picture of what individuals need during a panic attack we interviewed 10 
                    people who had either had a panic attack in the past or had frequently cared for someone who is 
                    prone to them . We sought to learn what are some typical situations that result in panic attacks, 
                    what frustrations people face when trying to reach out for help or help a loved one.
                </p>

                        <p>While help might benefit someone having a panic attack, actually going 
                            through the effort to ask can be embarrassing or overwhelming for some people. </p>

                            rejection from loved ones after reaching out doesn't help and could even make the 
                            situation worse. </p>

                <h2>Personas</h2>
                <p>
                    Based on the insights from our research, we created two personas to represent the two types of users 
                    our app would be designed for, people prone to panic attacks and their loved ones. 
                </p>
                <h3>Damien</h3> 
                <p>
                    <em>21 years old <br> Prone to panic attacks</em><br>
                    Damien has been dealing with frequent panic attacks for a few years. He has a strong network
                    of friends and loved ones that dont know much about panic attacks but want to do anything they 
                    can to comfort him. During his panic attacks, Damien wants help but has trouble using his phone
                    and he fears that he'll inconvienience his friends and family by needing immediate help often.
                </p>

                <h3>Aditya</h3> 
                <p>
                    <em>24 years old <br> Damien's close friend</em><br>
                    Aditya has known Damien for many years and frequently helps him during his panic attacks.
                    Aditya has a demanding job causing her to be busy most of the day and often she isn't immediately
                    available to help Damien. She also has trouble sometimes knowing what to say to get Damien to calm 
                    down. 
                </p>
                <h2>Journey Mapping Panic Attacks</h2>
                <p>
                    We then created a user journey map for our first persona that looks at reaching out during a panic attack to understand 
                    their feelings and needs of our users throughout the stages of a panic attack and how our app could 
                    address this.

                <p>
                    We started our design process by first laying out each page and how they were connected. This 
                    would allow us to clearly see which page served what purpose.

                <h2>Initial Prototyping</h2>
                <p>
                    We began to prototype variations of our app layout on post-its based on our user flow. We focused 
                    on a clean interface without too much stimuli to keep our user calm and focused.

                <h2>User Testing</h2>
                <p>
                    We asked potential users to navigate our prototypes to test our app's usability in action. We promted different 
                    situations for our users to test on the app such as "Ask for help." and "Respond to a loved ones 
                    panic attack and let them know your availability." All of our users found the app easy to navigate and interact with, finding 
                    relevant features fairly quickly. 

                    Overall our users saw potential in the app for people who needed it, wishing they had had the app in the past during tricky situations.

                        <p>Throughout the app we made sure to never have a negative or empty screen. For example, instead of showing a page with no responses
                            after pressing the panic button, we reassure the user and offer tips.
