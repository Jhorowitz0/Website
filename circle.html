                    <h4>"How can we design a caretaking application that quickly and easily connects someone in need
                        with an available member of their support circle with as little stress as possible?"

                    <p> For Many people prone to panic attacks, reaching out for help can be extremely difficult.
                        During a panic attack, some people might not want to navigate through their mobile device to 
                        seek help. Additionally, spending time looking for someone who is available to help instantly 
                        might not be possible during moments of panic
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My teamates and I set out to design a mobile app that would address this problem and focus on
                        getting people emotional support at a moments notice from people they trust. We analyzed what people
                        struggle with typicall during panic attacks and what usualy inhibits them from getting help.

                <p>
                    Dealing with panic attacks is a delicate subject. Before we began designing anything we needed to 
                    understand the situations our app would be used in and what can help. Our team began by first 
                    performing basic research on the process of panic attacks and what would benefit someone having a 
                    panic attack and how to assist caregivers in aiding their loved ones.

                <h2> Interviewing Potential Users</h2>
                <p>
                    In order to get a better picture of what individuals need during a panic attack we interviewed 10 
                    people who had either had a panic attack in the past or had frequently cared for someone who is 
                    prone to them . We sought to learn what are some typical situations that result in panic attacks, 
                    what frustrations people face when trying to reach out for help or help a loved one.
                </p>

                        <p>While help might benefit someone having a panic attack, actually going 
                            through the effort to ask can be embarrassing or overwhelming for some people. </p>

                            to call at short notice or wonâ€™t understand the severity of the panic attack. Dealing with 
                            rejection from loved ones after reaching out doesn't help and could even make the 
                            situation worse. </p>

                <p>
                    Based on the insights from our research, we created two personas to represent the two types of users 
                    our app would be designed for, people prone to panic attacks and their loved ones. We then created a 
                    user journey map for each persona to understand their feelings and needs throughout the stages of a 
                    panic attack and how our app could address this.

                    We started our design process by first laying out each page and how they were connected. This

                    We began to prototype variations of our app layout on post-its and index cards with a focus on 
                    a large button that would instantly reach out to loved ones when held.
